# Online Template for Brothers Design Portfolio
## This is my first running scalable site that I created for my brother to host his design portfolio.
## It is currently lacking as he wasn't as interested as I was in the project but the bones are functional!
## Some notable features are the flexible boxes for each project with are responsive to size and hover 
## as well as embedding 3d models which can be linked to and displayed through viewing each project
### please wait for the 3d models, edrawings load times are a little slow!
## I am looking to add features for his resume as soon as I get one as well as an area to send him emails for contact
## The project was created by using an ubuntu NGINX server which I completely configured
## adding, removing, and customizing the websites aspects are done through the data.json in assets/data
