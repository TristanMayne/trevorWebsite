# Online Template for Brothers Design Portfolio (trevormayne.com)
### This is my first running scalable site that I created for my brother to host his design portfolio. It is currently lacking as he wasn't as interested as I was in the project but the bones are functional! 
### Some notable features are the flexible boxes for each project which are responsive to size and hover as well as embedding 3d models which can be linked to and displayed through viewing each project (please wait for the 3d models, edrawings load times are a little slow!). 
### I am looking to add features for his resume as soon as I get a copy, an area to send him emails for contact, and improving the mobile experience. The project was created by using an ubuntu NGINX server which I completely configured. Adding, removing, and customizing the websites aspects are done through the data.json in assets/data.
